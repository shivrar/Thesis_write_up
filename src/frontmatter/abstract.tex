\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{T}he use of UltraWide Band technology to function as a positioning system in hard environments for localisation has been addressed in this dissertation.
    The overall goal is to achieve reliable position estimates that an indoor drone or robotic system can use while operating in this environment.
    A household kitchen falls under the case of hard environments, particularly with the presence of dynamic randomly occurring obstacles which result in a No Line of Sight challenge between the receivers and transmitters.
    It was found that while a receiver is in motion and NLOS occurred, erratic readings were obtained from the sensor making it not suitable for localisation when used in isolation.
    It is shown that the sensor readings can be integrated successfully in a Flight Control Unit and applying a simple sensor fusion algorithm with dead reckoning data is able to decrease the overall error of the positioning system.
