\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{T}he use of UltraWide Band technology in hard environments for localisation has been addressed in various formats.
    A household kitchen falls under the case of hard environments with the presence of dynamic obstacle randomly providing No Line of Sight between the receivers and transmitters.
    It was found that while a receiver is in motion and NLOS occurred, erratic readings would be given from the sensor making it not suitable for localisation when used in isolation.
    The overall goal is to achieve viable position estimates that an indoor drone or robotic system can use while operating in this environment.
    It is shown that the sensor readings can be integrated successfully in a Flight Control Unit and applying a simple sensor fusion algorithm with dead reckoning data is able to decrease the overall positional error of the system.
