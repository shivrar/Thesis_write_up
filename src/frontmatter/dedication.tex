\chapter*{Dedication and acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
    I would like to acknowledge and thank my mother, Sheila Radhanie, and sister, Arti K. Ramdhanie, whose continued support over this year has been instrumental in completing this programme and research.

    A special thanks to my supervisors, Dr. Wright and Prof. Caleb-Solly whose expertise, profound guidance and support made this achievement possible.

    Finally, thanks must go to my previous co-workers and friends at VirtanaTT who inspired me to further my passion for robotics and whose experience equipped me with the necessary tools needed to effectively complete projects like this.
